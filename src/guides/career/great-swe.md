What is the difference between an average software engineer and a exceptional sofware engineer?

### Intellectual curiosity
- An average software engineer is ok just using an api and assuming it’s magic
- An exceptional one wants to know how and why it works and how those constraints and nuances affect the system
Communication is good too though (Edited)

### Quality
- An average software engineer is ok to use something like PHP that lets them get the job done quickly
- An exceptional software engineer wants to build something that will last and is willing to take a bit more time to do it

### Role
- An average software engineer thinks about their own part and delivers it
- An exceptional software engineer thinks about how it fits into the rest of the team’s work and makes decisions on that basis

### Uplift Others
- An average software engineer works the best they can to deliver their own work
- An exceptional software engineer works to make everyone around them better

### Product Sense
- An average software engineer builds to the written requirements
- An exceptional software engineer builds to the actual needs

### Multiple
- An average software works in code
- An exceptional software engineer works in code, design docs, collaboration, whiteboard, testing, monitoring, and other media

### Constructive
- An average software engineer is critical
- An exceptional software engineer is constructive

### Wise
- An average software engineer wants to be an exceptional software engineer
- An exceptional software engineer knows when it’s appropriate to be an average software engineer

### Showing up
- An average software engineer does what they need to do
- An exceptional software engineer steps up

### Humility
- An average software engineer hopes they don’t get asked about something they don’t know
- An exceptional software engineer takes ownership of what they don’t know and therefore gets approached a lot
