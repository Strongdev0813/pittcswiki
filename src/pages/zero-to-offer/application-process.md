The good news is, the process to getting an internship follows a pretty simple formula:

- Make sure your resume is good
- Practice interviewing
- Apply and get an interview
- Pass the interview and get an offer

The hard part is getting the interview. Getting the interview involves having a good resume. Passing an interview is a matter of being prepared.

With top internship applications, you always need to start applying
much earlier than you expect. Recruiting for a 2021 Summer Internship
starts in Summer 2020. So, depending on when you are reading this, you
have different options.

### I am reading this in the summer

You should aim to land an internship for next summer. Follow
the tips provided to you in Zero to Offer and ask CSC members
for more guidance.

### I am reading this in the fall

You should mass apply to places _now_

### I am reading this in the spring

It is going to be really tough to land a 'top' internship this
summer. That being said, there are still **plenty** of other
internship oppurtunies to pursue. **TODO add guide for general internship advice**

## Application

First, get your resume reviewed before sending it out. After that, find a list to apply to internships, and literally mass apply.

## Timeline

Applications for summer internship start a year before. After you
apply, you will get ghosted from a ton. It is common to apply to 200 places and only hear back from 1 or 2.

Certain things increase your chances:

- More impressive resume (higher GPA, interesting projects, past expierence)
- Career Fairs
- Referrals
- General Networking

With all of these together, it is possible for you to at least land
a few interviews - especially if you have a decent resume and skills.

Interview prep is a good amount of work. Read more about there [here](/zero-to-offer/interview-prep)
