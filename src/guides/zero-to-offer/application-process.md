Getting a top-tier internship can be really daunting at first. The good news is, the process to getting an internship follows a pretty simple formula:

- Get an Interview
- Pass the Interview

Often, the hard part is getting the interview. Getting an interview involves having a good resume. Passing it is a matter of being prepared.

With top internship applications, you start applying
much earlier than you expect. Recruiting for a 2021 Summer Internship
starts in Summer 2020. As a result, different points of the year require different gameplans and approaches to getting an internship.

### I am reading this in the summer

You should aim to land an internship for next summer. Plan out the rest of your summer so that you [a strong resume](/zero-to-offer/resume) and [strong coding interviewing skills](/zero-to-offer/interview-prep) going into the fall.

Making projects, practicing LeetCode, and working jobs will be very challenging and test your persistence. Remember the hard work you put in is going to pay off soon.

### I am reading this in the fall

You should mass apply to places ASAP. To find companies [use this repository.](https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/Summer2021-Internships) We highly recommend getting your resume reviewed as well.

While you apply, make sure you are prepared for coding interviews. We recommend [Leetcode](http://leetcode.com/)) for relevant coding questions!

### I am reading this in the spring

It is going to be really tough to land a 'top' internship this
summer. That being said, there are still **plenty** of other
internship opportunities to pursue. A lot of companies will still be hiring at this point. Look up companies near your hometown and university on LinkedIn and Handshake and see if they are still hiring.

Another option would be to pursue [research opportunities](/academics/research/). Ask any CS professors you've had and see if you could work on their research with them.

Obviously it's disappointing that you won't get a 'top' internship this summer, but having relevant work will exponentially help your chances in the future for a 'top' internship or new grad job.

## Application

Before you apply, we highly recommend students to get their resume reviewed before applying. Luckily CSC does free resume reviews for Pitt CS students!

Once your resume looks good, apply to [on this list](https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/Summer2021-Internships). In general if you are looking for your first top-tier internship you shouldn't be too selective and just apply to all the companies that you can.

However, if you have a good internship under your belt feel free to apply to only the companies you're interested in!

## The State of CS Applications

Typically the applications for the Summer comes out in mid-July to September. It is extremely common for tech companies to not respond to their applicants, aka 'ghosting.'

Because of this trend, **we highly recommend students to apply to as many companies as they can.** Think about it like this: If only 10% of the companies you apply to will respond for an interview, you'd much rather apply to 100 than 10.

Certain things will definitely increase your chances of getting an interview:

- A strong resume (higher GPA, coding projects, relevant work experience)
- Meeting recruiters at Career Fair
- Referrals from employees.

With all of these together, you should at least land
a few interviews. The next step would be passing these interviews. Follow our guide [here](/zero-to-offer/interview-prep) to learn more!
