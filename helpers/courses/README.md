# Course Scraper

This will make sure that the courses on SCI match up with the courses
that we have on our wiki by comparing what we scraped last.

```
npm run test
```

In effort to make the course documentation we have always up to date, we scrape the SCI website
and place that into `autogenerated_course_descriptions.json`.

This will scrape classes and save it into the `autogenerated_course_descriptions.json` file

```
npm run scrape_courses --save
```

We also have a command to auto generate Markdown files for each
courses.

```
npm run scrape_courses --generatemarkdown
```

The idea is that, we use `autogenerated_course_descriptions.json` to create
the the listing on the courses page of the wiki. For weird, custom things
like ignoring a class or replacing a course information, we have a `custom_course_info_overrides.json` file.
