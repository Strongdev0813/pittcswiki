# What hackathons are here at Pitt?

Here at the Pitt, we have a great diversity of hackathons for you to attend over the course of a school year. These include SteelHacks, SheInnovates, Pitt Challenge, and Hacking4Humanity. Each of these hackathons function differently, with different goals and themes in mind. Let's explore through them!

## SteelHacks
Steelhacks is the one of the largest hackathon in Pittsburgh, and is an MLH affiliated event. This is put on directly by the School of Computing and Information and the is just a general hackathon with no specific theme. This event is incredibly fun, and due to it's general nature allows you to make or build whatever you want. This is event is the closet to a sort of true form of a hackathon where it's more about you build, learning, and experimenting. We don't offer cash prizes, but instead lesser but fairly good prizes such as computer monitors, good wireless headphones, etc. 

## SheInnovates
SheInnovates is our Women's Hackathon (though men can participate). This is also run through the School of Computing and Information with the help of WICS (Women in Computer Science). This is a great hackathon for begineers, especially for women. A lot of the participants experience their first hackathon at SheInnovates and we very much keep a very comfortable and open atmosphere. This hackathon is not an MLH afflicated event and, just like steelhacks, doesn't have cash prizes but has still fairly good prizes. The reason for this is we find that MLH and cash prizes can make the event fairly competitive and possibly turn away individuals that aren't comfortable to participate in such an event.

## The Pitt Challenge
Pitt Challenge is a hackathon that's themed and focused on healthcare problems, and is an MLH affiliated event. With being a themed hackathon their challenges are specified ahead of time and this hackathon is definitely more competitive as their prizes are usually bigger than the ones of SteeelHacks and SheInnovates and typically includes cash prizes. This hackathon is put on by the School of Pharmacy and teh Clinical and Translational Science Institute.

## Hacking4Humanity
Hacking4Humanity is a hackathon themed toward more social issue problems, with each year focusing on one issue. Some of these issues include human trafficing and digital disinformation. This hackathon is put on by the Institute for Cyber Law, Policy, and Security, and is typically a fairly small hackathon (usually less than 15 team participating), but dispite the size does yield, like all other hackathons, amazing projects with incredible solutions.
