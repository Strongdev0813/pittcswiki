Even if you worked really hard, chances are you are going to get
rejected.

Rejection is sucky. But, every rejection is one step closer to an acceptance. It means you are doing something right (you are trying),
but also maybe you have stuff to work on. There is a lot of luck involved in this process - a lot of times rejections are not logical.
In any case, there are always ways you improve . your ability. It is
just an internship. It is not the end of the world.

## Assortment of Tips and Tricks

- Jealously is not productive. If your friends have received internships that . you got rejected from, that is good for both of you.
  It means you have friends that you can learn more from! (And perhaps refer you in the future)

- Be persistent, and success will follow

- Companies are mean to freshmen. There are freshmen only programs. View our guide on those here (TODO add a freshmen specific career advice page)

      	- Look for freshmen / sophomore specific internships (Facebook University, Google STEP)

- A large amount of luck is involved. Luck however, is when oppurtunity meets preperation. This is why besides just focusing LeetCode, we recommened developing genuine foundational skills.

- Apply to as many companies as you can. You never know what companies
  you will like, and applying does not take a lot of your time.

- Ask people for advice. People are willing to help you - if you
  ask for it.

- Do not renege an offer (This is when you accept and sign an
  internship offer but later change your mind about it) - Ask someone in Pitt CSC for more guidance on this topic.

- Seek out opportunities! We go to school in a popular city - There are a lot of profressors that can use your help if you are willing to help them and can sell yourself. You can learn a lot that way - Go to Pitt CSC Events - the CSC Officers put a lot of time into setting up recruiting events to help _you_ !
