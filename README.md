testimonials google sheet. You can download this JSON file in the Pitt CSC Wiki [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gj8PFneOhnre0uFxrx4Fb_qB1zAeNPc6) or ask an officer for access. You can also set the `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the value of the JSON string.

```
yarn start
```
