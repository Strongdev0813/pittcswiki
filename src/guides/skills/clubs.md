Being a part of student organizations is an integral part of one's college experience. As a CS student at Pitt you'll have a large amount of clubs to choose from. In this guide we'll be introducing the clubs directly related to the Computer Science major. 

However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't join other non-CS related organizations! In fact we recommend joining both CS related and non-CS related student organizations. There are a lot of really cool people to meet at Pitt and doing so will allow you to meet a breadth of people.

**Note:** If you run a CS-related organization and would like to add or edit the profile of your org here, please email us at wiki@pittcsc.org!
