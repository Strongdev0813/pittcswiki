This is going to be a lot of work - but that does not mean it will not be enjoyable.

Just as med students have to study hard for years, prepare for and pass the MCAT, you need to prepare and study become a better programmer, and prepare and pass your interviews.

As a college student, you might wonder if you have the time for all of this - and you definitely do. College is a time of having fun and
experimenting to figure out what you like or dislike. Even if it
is a lot of work, it will be fun and worth it.

> You can still have a lot of fun and apply for internships!

## Perception

CMU > Pitt

## Reality

Pitt > CMU, Stanford, Harvard, etc ...

(Even if you are not a Pitt student, this advice probably applies) As a non-top-tier CS college student, you might feel insecure, or at a disadvantage when
thinking about internships, especially since we are right next to a top tier CS school.

The reality is, while Pitt is not technically a "top tier" CS school,
it does not at all mean you cannot get great internships. Our CS curriculum is good! (even it is isnt, you can learn a lot from watching other online courses on the Internet).

Other CS schools like University of Waterloo, CMU, Stanford, etc, probably do have better career fairs and co-op systems to help the
internship program. Initially, it is normal to feel jealous because of this.

However, a silver lining is that Pitt CS does not have a rat race culture. We have a relaxed, supportive, and collaborative culture. Take advantage of this and contribute to it!

Pitt is secretly a better school then every other school (if you are reading this and you do not go to Pitt, we are half joking). For one, we have a better culture. Two, we are underdogs. Since we have to work harder to get internships, it actually gives us the edge in the long term.

Just because you do not go to Stanford does not mean anything. You go to a great school. There will always be a bunch of really smart students and teachers to learn from It is up to you to take advantage of the oppurtunies given to you, and make oppurtunies for yourself.

You chose to come to Pitt. If you want to get a job you like, you 100% can you just need to be proactive about it.
