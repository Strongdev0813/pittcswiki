We highly recommend reading through (Tech Interview Handbook)[https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/] Tech Interview Handbook gives great details and advice on the interview process.

They have a specific guide on resumes you can read [here](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/resume).

We recommend getting your resume reviewed. A CSC Officer can do this for you if you email it and also connect you to people in the industry
that will also review it.
