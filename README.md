Check out brainstorming on the issues page!

## Instructions
If you want to run this locally, you need to get access to the Pitt CSC course
testimonials google sheet. You can download this JSON file (if you are a CS officer) from Google API on the pittcsc@gmail.com account, and place it in the root of your directory when developing. Or you can set the `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to that JSON string.
