        <p>
          Information is power. We want to ensure that everyone has equal access
          to quality information they need to succeed. During our time at Pitt,
          we noticed most wisdom was just spread across individuals talking to
          other individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you did not happen to know the right people, you would be at a
          disadvantage. As students progress through college, everyone gains
          tidbits of knowledge that could be useful to future generations and
          have no good place to share it. We started compiling information into
          this Wiki to try to fix that. Each successive group of students should
          be better equipped than the last.
