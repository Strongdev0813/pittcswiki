> You can make a website and put it online for for free in less than 2 hours

You probably fall into two categories: A) You know at least basic web dev, B) You do not know web dev.

If you are in category A, building a personal website will likely take you less than 2 hours. If you are in category B, this is a great way to learn basic web development!

## Why Make a Website? (It is Free)

Making a personal website is likely not going to get you a job. However, you never know what might come out of it!

- Some job applications might have a 'website' field and actually having one will make you stand out
- If you link your website on your resume and have a portfolio section, you never know what jobs might actually look at it! (A big reason why I got a Google internship offer was because of my website)
- You will learn something by deploying something to the Internet

## How?

You need a GitHub account, know basic HTML, and be familiar with how to use Git. If you do not know any of this, take 3 hours of your life and try to learn these skills because they will pay a ridiculous amount in your future. [Watch this 15 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQLK8Ib_SKk) to get started.

Spend another 4 minutes looking at [this post](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/) on how to make your website look decent.

<!-- TODO link webdev skill -->

1. Make a GitHub repository named `username.github.io` where `username` is your GitHub user name.
1. Make sure it is public
1. Create an `index.html` file in this folder.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>REPLACE_ME</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="blurb">
        <h1>Hi there, I'm REPLACE_ME!</h1>
        <p>Who am I?</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <footer>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="mailto:REPLACE_ME@gmail.com">REPLACE_ME</a></li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/REPLACE_ME">github.com/REPLACE_ME</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here is something to get you started. Be sure to replace `REPLACE_ME` with the actual content.

1. Commit and publish to GitHub! You should be able to see it on your GitHub repo and if you go to https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/ you should see your web page.

## How to get free a custom domain?

You can actually get a custom domain for _free_ through Namecheap! University students can get a `.me` domain for free here: https://nc.me/

This will only last for a year so keep that in mind!

Then you can link your Github repo to your free domain by visiting [here](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages/)!
